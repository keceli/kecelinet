# About me
I am interested in developing methods that enables a predictive understanding of electronic and vibrational structure of molecules and extended systems. Quantum mechanics gives us the formulations required for a quantitative description of the chemical interactions; however, the complexity of these equations grows rapidly with the system size. We need clever algorithms, efficient implementations and powerful computers to be able to solve these equations. Indeed, there is one more component that help us in this challenge. That is "data". The machine learning revolution in the industry brought us powerful data analytics tools and high-throughput experiments and simulations give us lots of data. Therefore, I am also interested in designing workflows consisting of data generation, storage and analysis. I believe that complementing formula-driven approaches with data-driven models will allow us to solve the most challenging scientific problems.
